        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            GardenLend was founded with the idea of making it easy for people to access gardening equipment in their neighborhood. 
            We believe in sustainability and sharing resources, giving everyone the opportunity to enjoy the outdoors without the need for large investments.

        </p>
        <p>
            From lawnmowers to hedge trimmers, we offer a wide range of tools that are accessible to everyone. 
            With GardenLend, we aim to fill the gap between gardeners and the tools they need. 
            Whether you are an experienced gardener or just starting out, our platform allows you to find and borrow the right tools from people near you.
        </p>
        <p>
            To support our mission and maintain the platform, we offer our tools for a small rental fee.
            This allows us to keep expanding our services while promoting sustainability.
            Additionally, for every booking, we donate 1 euro to the Arbor Day Foundation, which plants a tree on your behalf.
            By using GardenLend, you not only access the tools you need but also contribute positively to the environment.
